            Through my internship I had the opportunity to work and learn a lot about data, to acquire analytical skills, as well as skills related to logical reasoning and understanding data quality.

Therefore, and thanks to all the knowledge acquired, my future project is to work as a data analyst in a public institution or in the banking world.
